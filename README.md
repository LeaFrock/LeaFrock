## 👋 Hi, I'm LeaFrock. 

* 🏫 I'm a Senior Backend Engineer specializing in .NET, living in *Shanghai, China*.

* 💪 I've been deeply involved in professional C# development since 2015, building a strong foundation and expertise in this domain. Over the years, I've worked on a variety of challenging and rewarding projects, ranging from game backend development to web crawling and web backend services.

* 🎯 I'm passionate about building high-performance backend systems that drive high-quality user experiences. I take pride in my ability to solve complex problems and optimize performance, includes working on projects that require real-time data processing, low-latency responses, and efficient resource utilization.

* 🌐 I enjoy contributing to the open source community through writing articles, participating in projects, and engaging with fellow developers. Whether it's sharing knowledge, working on open-source projects, or collaborating on innovative solutions, I believe in the power of community and continuous learning.

* 💬 I'm always open to discussing .NET/C# related topics (especially those involving performance optimization and best practices) and exploring collaboration opportunities in these areas.

## 🤪 Have fun!
